# Terraform Core Knowledge
In this area you should find some general knowledge to getting started and getting comfortable will Terraform skill sets.

## Recommended Learning
I generally like to begin study of a new area by studying for certifications. Most organizations that offer certification for their tools usually compile and organize the knowledge needed to gain basic competency. With Terraform I recommend stusdying with the study guide used for their Terraform Associate certification.

The outline for this [study guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-study) is as follows:

- Learn about IaC
- Manage Infrastructure
- Master the workflow
- Learn more subcommands
- Use and create modules
- Read and write configuration
- Manage State
- Debug Terraform
- Understand Terraform Cloud and Enterprise

I try to design labs or drills to help build skill sets for each of these areas in the Labs and Learning folder. Additionaly, the [study guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/associate-study) has tutorials that are very helpful.

## Other Helpful Resources
I have found Anton Babenko's content especially helpful. You can check out his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGH0yYPvlCN1VjSFMGVmFgQ) for weekly content.
