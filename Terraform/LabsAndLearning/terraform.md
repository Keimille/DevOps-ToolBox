# Labs & Drills

I have included some labs I have refrenced or created myself to drill weak areas or to learn new tasks to actually apply knowledge to developing a skill. 
I try to categorize each lab by refrencing the area I am working on under each topic title. In all excersies I attempt to recall the code from memory instead of refrencing material.
However, there are links to the answers within the repository.

## Workspace
### Lab 1 - Navigating Local Workspaces 
1. Create a workspace named test in the command line and navigate between the two.
2. List all workspaces
3. switch to default workspace
4. Destroy test workspace
