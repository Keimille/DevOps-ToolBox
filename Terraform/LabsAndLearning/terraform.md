# Labs & Drills

I have included some labs I have refrenced or created myself to drill weak areas or to learn new tasks to actually apply knowledge to developing a skill. 
I try to categorize each lab by refrencing the area I am working on under each topic title. In all excersies I attempt to recall the code from memory instead of refrencing material.
However, there are links to the answers within the repository.
