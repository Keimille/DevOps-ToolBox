# Labs & Drills

I have included some labs I have refrenced or created myself to drill weak areas or to learn new tasks to actually apply knowledge to developing a skill. 
I try to categorize each lab by refrencing the area I am working on under each topic title. In all excersies I attempt to recall the code from memory instead of refrencing material.
However, there are links to the answers within the repository.

## Workspace

### Lab 1 - Navigating Local Workspaces

1. Create a workspace named test in the command line and navigate between the two.
2. List all workspaces
3. Switch to default workspace
4. Destroy test workspace

## Modules

### Lab 1 - Sourcing a Module and Specific Version from Github

1. Create a module repository from Github or [fork this one](https://github.com/Keimille/terraform-aws-s3website)
2. Create a terraform plan without any errors

### Lab 2 - Source a Module That is Located Locally

1.Clone the repository mentioned in Lab 1
2. Create a terraform plan without any errors by sourcing the module locally

## Syntax

### Drill 1 - Create EC2 resource

1. Recall only one resource block that creates two ec2 instances resource without refrencing documentation. Include tags to include ami id, and instance type.
