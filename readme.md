# DevOps Toolbox

This project is meant to be a learning  and refrence tool to aspiring DevOps professionals our to continue to learn new things.
People are encouraged to use this in their learning efforts to learn new things or practice old one's. This particular project is a
companion to Kamran Ahmed's [Developer Road Map](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). I make some deviations to his
road map in order to modify for my specific situation and background.
